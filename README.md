# 🤔 How to Use? 

Setup
  Download Repo
  Make sure you have python3, pip, and venv installed. If you're not sure, 
    python3 --version
    pip --version
    python3 -m venv
  Open a terminal or cmd and navigate to project dir
    source/bin/activate (Linux)
    venv/scripts/activate (Windows) 
    pip install -r requirements.txt (I've included the requirements.txt for the project) 
    
   Now the fun stuff!
    I will emulate the directory structure in Github
    Basically in project dir, have a temp and gifs folder
    in setup.py, change the file to the specific gif you want to use (include it in gif folder) 
    Thats it! Once you've modified setup.py to your gif (included in gifs/) just run.py
  
# ⚡ A Word of Caution
  
CPU and RAM usage can be heavy for gifs with lots of frames or high frame rates. I would recommend pausing script when you're gaming, heavy computing, etc. 
  
 # 📊 Optimization
 
 I'm experimenting with ways to make this run better. Feel free to email me at witzenmank1185@uhcl.edu if
 you have any ideas or wanna tell me where explorer.exe holds its pointers to the wallpaper bitmap 😊
