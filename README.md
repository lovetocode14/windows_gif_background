Animate Windows Backgrounds with gifs

CPU and RAM usage can be heavy for gifs with lots of frames or high frame rates. I would recommend pausing script when you're gaming, heavy computing, etc. 

The get_frames_and_duration() method of setup_gif.py can be used to get the total number of frames (needed for loop in run_gif.py) and the duration (time.sleep(average duration))
  The average duration is average duration of each frame in gifs. It is usually uniform for looping background gifs. 
  
  I will update this code to make it more plug and play with the needed values of run_gif.py but thought I would share for now.
